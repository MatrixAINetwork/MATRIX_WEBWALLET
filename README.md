## Function Overview
The web wallet consists of the following parts:

•	My Wallet: You can create a new wallet or open a wallet, then you can use all the functions.

•	Online/Offline Mode: Online mode or offline mode can be selected, offline mode can better guarantee wallet safety.

•	Green Mining: You can deposit for miners/validators masternodes and set up secondary key.

•	Joint Mining: The creators create the mining pool and provide the mining equipment. Other participants only need to stake for mining and earn the mining rewards.
